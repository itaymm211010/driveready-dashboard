## 🚀 How to Use Agents

### Option 1: Team-Based Work (Recommended for complex tasks)

Create a team with multiple agents:

```bash
# Example: Feature development with full stack
Team: Database Engineer + Integration Engineer + UI Designer + Test Specialist
```

### Option 2: Individual Agent

Invoke a single agent for focused work:

```bash
# Example: Security audit before deployment
Agent: Security Auditor
```

### Option 3: Sequential Work

Use agents in sequence for phased development:

```bash
1. Database Engineer → Create schema
2. Integration Engineer → Build hooks
3. UI Designer → Create components
4. Test Specialist → Write tests
5. Logic Validator → Verify correctness
6. Security Auditor → Final security check
```
